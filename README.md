# Readme

[EveryPolitician](http://everypolitician.org/) provides its data in [Popolo](http://www.popoloproject.com/) format.
If you want to interact with this data from Node then this module makes that task simpler.


## About

This project uses [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) for JavaScript tests.

There is an ESlint configuration file to check the JS syntax.

Also, CI files have been added to be used with Travis and GitLab.


## Installing

### Requirements

You need [Node and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).
Before you install node, you may want to install a node version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

This is a work in progress.


### To install dependencies:

```js
npm install
```

## Tests

The test command will run both Jasmine and ESLint.

### To run the tests:

```js
npm test
```
