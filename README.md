# Readme

[EveryPolitician](http://everypolitician.org/) provides its data in [Popolo](http://www.popoloproject.com/) format.
If you want to interact with this data from Node then this module makes that task simpler.


## About

CI files have been added to be used with Travis and GitLab.


## Installing

### Requirements

You need [Node and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).
Before you install node, you may want to install a node version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

This is a work in progress.
